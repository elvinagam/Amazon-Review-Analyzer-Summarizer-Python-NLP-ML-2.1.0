# Small explanation of How it Works?
NLP: TF-IDF and Cosine similarity

```Document 1: The game of life is a game of everlasting learning```
```Document 2: The unexamined life is not worth living```
```Document 3: Never stop learning```

Let us imagine that you are doing a search on these documents with the following query: life learning

The query is a free text query. It means a query in which the terms of the query are typed freeform into the search interface, without any connecting search operators.

Let us go over each step in detail to see how it all works.

Step 1: Term Frequency (TF)
Term Frequency also known as TF measures the number of times a term (word) occurs in a document. Given below are the terms and their frequency on each of the document.

TF for Document 1

Document1 the game of life is a everlasting learning
Term Frequency 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1
TF for Document 2

Document2 the unexamined life is not worth living
Term Frequency 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
TF for Document 3

Document3 never stop learning
Term Frequency 1 1 1

In reality each document will be of different size. On a large document the frequency of the terms will be much higher than the smaller ones. Hence we need to normalize the document based on its size. A simple trick is to divide the term frequency by the total number of terms. For example in Document 1 the term game occurs two times. The total number of terms in the document is 10. Hence the normalized term frequency is 2 / 10 = 0.2. Given below are the normalized term frequency for all the documents.

Normalized TF for Document 1

Document1 the game of life is a everlasting learning
Normalized TF 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1
Normalized TF for Document 2

Document2 the unexamined life is not worth living
Normalized TF 0.142857 0.142857 0.142857 0.142857 0.142857 0.142857 0.142857
Normalized TF for Document 3

Document3 never stop learning
Normalized TF 0.333333 0.333333 0.333333

Step 2: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
The main purpose of doing a search is to find out relevant documents matching the query. In the first step all terms are considered equally important. In fact certain terms that occur too frequently have little power in determining the relevance. We need a way to weigh down the effects of too frequently occurring terms. Also the terms that occur less in the document can be more relevant. We need a way to weigh up the effects of less frequently occurring terms. Logarithms helps us to solve this problem.

Let us compute IDF for the term game:
*IDF(game) = 1 + loge(Total Number Of Documents / Number Of Documents with term game in it)

There are 3 documents in all = Document1, Document2, Document3
The term game appears in Document1

IDF(game) = 1 + loge(3 / 1)
= 1 + 1.098726209
= 2.098726209*

Given below is the IDF for terms occurring in all the documents. Since the terms: the, life, is, learning occurs in 2 out of 3 documents they have a lower score compared to the other terms that appear in only one document.

Terms IDF
the 1.405507153
game 2.098726209
of 2.098726209
life 1.405507153
is 1.405507153
a 2.098726209
everlasting 2.098726209
learning 1.405507153
unexamined 2.098726209
not 2.098726209
worth 2.098726209
living 2.098726209
never 2.098726209
stop 2.098726209

Step 3: TF * IDF
Remember we are trying to find out relevant documents for the query: life learning

For each term in the query multiply its normalized term frequency with its IDF on each document. In Document1 for the term life the normalized term frequency is 0.1 and its IDF is 1.405507153. Multiplying them together we get 0.140550715 (0.1 * 1.405507153). Given below is TF * IDF calculations for life and learning in all the documents.

Document1 Document2 Document3
life 0.140550715 0.200786736 0
learning 0.140550715 0 0.468502384
Step 4: Vector Space Model – Cosine Similarity
From each document we derive a vector. If you need some refresher on vector refer here. The set of documents in a collection then is viewed as a set of vectors in a vector space. Each term will have its own axis. Using the formula given below we can find out the similarity between any two documents.

*Cosine Similarity (d1, d2) = Dot product(d1, d2) / ||d1|| * ||d2||*

Dot product (d1,d2) = d1[0] * d2[0] + d1[1] * d2[1] * … * d1[n] * d2[n]*
||d1|| = square root(d1[0]2 + d1[1]2 + … + d1[n]2)
||d2|| = square root(d2[0]2 + d2[1]2 + … + d2[n]2)

The cosine measure similarity is another similarity metric that depends on envisioning user preferences as points in space. Hold in mind the image of user preferences as points in an n-dimensional space. Now imagine two lines from the origin, or point (0,0,…,0), to each of these two points. When two users are similar, they’ll have similar ratings, and so will be relatively close in space—at least, they’ll be in roughly the same direction from the origin. The angle formed between these two lines will be relatively small. In contrast, when the two users are dissimilar, their points will be distant, and likely in different directions from the origin, forming a wide angle. This angle can be used as the basis for a similarity metric in the same way that the Euclidean distance was used to form a similarity metric. In this case, the cosine of the angle leads to a similarity value. If you’re rusty on trigonometry, all you need to remember to understand this is that the cosine value is always between –1 and 1: the cosine of a small angle is near 1, and the cosine of a large angle near 180 degrees is close to –1. This is good, because small angles should map to high similarity, near 1, and large angles should map to near –1.

The query entered by the user can also be represented as a vector. We will calculate the TF*IDF for the query

TF IDF TF*IDF
life 0.5 1.405507153 0.702753576
learning 0.5 1.405507153 0.702753576
Let us now calculate the cosine similarity of the query and Document1. You can do the calculation using this tool.

Cosine Similarity(Query,Document1) = Dot product(Query, Document1) / ||Query|| * ||Document1||

Dot product(Query, Document1)
= ((0.702753576) * (0.140550715) + (0.702753576)*(0.140550715))
= 0.197545035151

||Query|| = sqrt((0.702753576)2 + (0.702753576)2) = 0.993843638185

||Document1|| = sqrt((0.140550715)2 + (0.140550715)2) = 0.198768727354

Cosine Similarity(Query, Document) = 0.197545035151 / (0.993843638185) * (0.198768727354)
= 0.197545035151 / 0.197545035151
= 1

Given below is the similarity scores for all the documents and the query

Document1 Document2 Document3
Cosine Similarity 1 0.707106781 0.707106781
I plotted vector values for the query and documents in 2-dimensional space of life and learning. Document1 has the highest score of 1. This is not surprising as it has both the terms life and learning.

Nowadays, thanks to the advances in modern technology, especially in the IT sector, more and more people are using online shopping services namely, Amazon, AliExpress, eBay. Even though it is a piece of cake to purchase an item using this kind of website, there can be some cases in which things do not go as it was expected to be. Some people in these foregoing websites can fraud customers or tell a lie about a particular product. To prevent the possibility of these kinds of unwanted actions, customers tend to read reviews of tens of thousands of products during their everyday life. It is time-consuming and we all know how precious the time is in today’s “busy world”. Even if a particular customer reads a review and feels satisfied, it can be a fake one and can mislead thousands of people to buy that product. To solve these issues, we need to eliminate the time waste which we spent on reading thousands of sentences. Moreover, we should also in some way figure out the fake reviews. A tool would be beneficial if it can differ fake and real reviews using special methods. Additionally, it would be time-saving if we had a tool that summarizes even tens of thousands of sentences. Since it is urgently needed in today’s society, people would even pay for it to save their precious time. The foregoing needed project is our project and its resultant tool in the end. With the help of the advances in modern technology, namely Artificial Intelligence, our tool will summarize the texts of even thousands of words and give feedback according to it which would be short several sentences. Starting from identifying the fake reviews with the help of different methods, it will also store the corresponding processed reviews in the local database in the initial stage of the implementation to retrieve faster whenever it is needed.
In this document of Test Management System, developed software is tested both manually and automatically in terms of its functionalities and features. In the project diagrams section, diagrams of the project are included, such as WBS, Gantt Chart, Context, E-R and Class diagrams. Then the user requirements are listed according to their priority criterion (“High”, “Medium”, “Low”). Obviously, each will have its own system, functional and non-functional requirements, with sequence diagrams and source codes. Next, in the test management part, Test Process diagram is drawn showing Defect Management such as Smoke, Retest, Regression test. Then in the use case scenario, Excel file is included containing all the requirements and their implementations and test systems. Excel file has its Domains, Sub-domains, Functional Areas, Use Case and Test Case title and descriptions, where the testing system occurs.
Priority of the systems are determined according to the three options, being “High”, “Medium”, “Low” prioritized sections. High priority types are the one which are the most crucial parts of the project, such as Review Scraping, Sentiment Analysis and Polarity Analysis in our project. These are some of the main blocks of the project where if any of these has defect while working, then that means that whole system has either flaws or doesn’t work at all – which also defines the “Critical” Defect Severity. Medium prioritized parts of the project are the sections with average importance to the project and when having issues in working, those can cause “Major” Defect Severity, such as Filtering Fake Reviews section in our project. When it comes to the Low priority parts of the project, these are the less important and trivial sections of the project where the system can still fully function even when foregoing parts have issues while working. Any issues in these stages causes Minor level problems which is also suggested to be fixed. 
As mentioned above, functionalities are tested manually, and automatically where tests are conducted with the help of execution steps. While, on the other hand, automatic test cases are conducted with the help of the test scripts using the Selenium framework.
